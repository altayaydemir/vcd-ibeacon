# Ionic iBeacon Demo Project

A demo application for trying Ionic app with [Cordova iBeacon Plugin](https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon)

Since I haven't find a way to interact with the iBeacon with my computer, it's not useful as I expected. 

We can see the working interface only on iPhone. So we need to create dummy data or deploy app to iPhone everytime we want to see changes on the interface.
