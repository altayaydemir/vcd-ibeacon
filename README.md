# Ionic - iBeacon Demo Project

A demo application for trying [Ionic Mobile App Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) with [Cordova iBeacon Plugin](https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon).

Made for the hint part of the puzzle game we're dealing in VCD 481 (Physical Interaction Design) Course.

It's working as expected on iOS, screenshots will be added after the presentation.
