# Ionic iBeacon Demo Project

A demo application for trying Ionic app with [Cordova iBeacon Plugin](https://github.com/petermetz/cordova-plugin-ibeacon)

Since I haven't find a way to interact with the iBeacon with my computer, it's not useful at all. 
We can see the working interface only on iPhone. (and deploying to iOS without a developer account was harder than I expected)
